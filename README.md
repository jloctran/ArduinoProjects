# ArduinoProjects
Hi, I'm John!
I graduated from the University of Houston 2019 with a bachelor's in biomedical sciences. Shortly after, I started working on clinical trials involving medical devices. 
This prompted me to be very interested in biomedical engineering. I decided to pursue my masters degree in it.
Wanting to expand on my technical skills as well, I began to learn how to utilize an arduino board and its associated circuitry and code. 
This repository includes some projects I decided to work on.
